HTML AND CSS PROJECTS

	This contains several samples of websites I made using HTML and CSS.

TRAVIS'S RECIPE SITE

	This was an example of a website use to display recipe combinations I would try
	and rate using popular recipes from the internet.

ACADEMY CINEMA SITE

	This page is an example of  a movie theater. I designed this using Boostrap 4. 
	The main Boostrap components displayed in this one are the navbar, jumbotron, form,
	cards, and dropdowns.

SPACE STATION SITE

	This is an example home page for a Space travel company. Its styled using CSS and 
	contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

LESSON FOLDER

	This folder contains challenges give out during the course in which I was apple to 
	practice specific code and start developing some of the thinking processes required to 
	design, build and maintain websites and other programs.

The final file is a template I use to start up each of the HTML files I use.
