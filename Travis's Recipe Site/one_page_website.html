	<section id="about">
		<p> I am Travis Heckel, I am 28 years old and happily married. I currently am studying computer sciences and enjoy any kind of technology. I have no formal training as a cook and I really only tried to learn to cook starting the last two years.</p>	
		<p> I have found that so many cool recipes have already been created that all I have been doing is finding the ones I enjoy and seeing how I can mix and match, especially with little time or money spent in experimenting.</p>
		<p> Just like this recipe: </p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/watch?v=vHvwUEHcyvA"  alt="sorry I forgot how to do this"></iframe>
